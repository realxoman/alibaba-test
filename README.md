# Ali Baba Test

[Demo](https://countryrest-aliesm-alibaba.netlify.app/)

## Bonus
I think I Solve these bonuses challenge:

1 - Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

2 - Make all content server-side rendered and also have a fallback if the server-side render faces an error

3 - Collect analytical data (in whichever way you prefer) using Google Analytics

4 - Make sure the ratio for the country flags is 4:3 or any other ratio you find suitable (I use 3 / 2 ratio)

5 - Add lazy loading for country images and list

## It's fully responsive also tablet mode

## Note

I don't Complete All of the Bonus Tasks but I try to give my best in this time.
Right Now, I'm really not ready for this Role. But I will practice more for your next apply program.
Thanks For Challenge.
